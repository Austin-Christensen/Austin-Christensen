### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
My name's Austin Christensen. I have successfully completed a software development bootcamp at Tech Elevator and pursuing my passion in coding and complex problem solving. For the last eight years, I've been a dedicated Marine working as an avionics technician at MCAS Yuma. During that period, I have developed proficiency in finding solutions in time sensitive environments while thriving in collaborative situations and leadership positions. At this pivot in my life, the opportunity to follow a path in software development has sparked that passion of complex problem solving. I am excited to continue to grow in this field and collaborate with the incredible minds around me.
